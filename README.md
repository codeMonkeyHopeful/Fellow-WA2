## Weekend Assignment 2

### Family Visualization
Based on last week I can tell how much everyone loved their families ❤️

So this week, we're going to take the code from last week, make some slight modifications, and create a visualization for it. This week will be **testless**, which might scare you, but I think the creative freedom it affords you will be very nice! The overall goal is to accomplish something that looks like this:

I've laid the foundation of some of this but would like to expressly lay out some rules.

1. Id like if most if not all styling is done in the CSS file. That being said, I am ok with you bringing in a CSS library if you're familiar with one or like one.
2. I do not want the `index.html` file modified. Its perfect as is. This is a forced learning opportunity to learn some of the vanilla JavaScript ways to interact with the DOM. This assignment is leading into a week of `DOM` stuff, and this is a conscious decision.

This weekend assignment may involve some documentation reading! Probably more then you're used too. Its a good thing, and we should be working on learning from documentation (and each other) as much as possible.

The other thing that might arise is that you finish the beginnings of this early on. If thats the case, you can see that I've added 'age' to the `FamilyTree` class. I want us to use this to offer one additional piece of functionality (that I've provided no boiler plate for) that is sorting the family by age both ways. This will involve being able to change your normal view!

Im considering that part extra credit for now, but you should try to see if you can get there!

### Usage
1. Navigate to your 1904-FLEX-NY directory. Make sure you've `git pull upstream master` to ensure you have the latest changes. `git checkout -b wa2` to create a new branch to work on afterwards!
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start-wa2`
4. This opens a server hosting a page at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
5. Work in the `main.css` and `index.js` files. You can refresh your browser page to see any changes you make in those immediately!
